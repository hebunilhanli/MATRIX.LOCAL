# Project Title
MATRIX.LOCAL

# Scope
It will be practically penetration test about Active Directory. Active Directory is the directory service used on Microsoft networks. Active Directory stores all information of the organization, such as users, computers, locations, printers. If you pay attention to this site, I’ve always posted information on the practice. I’m not going to give much theoretical knowledge in this series.

# Installing
You can access the installation stages on my website.
